*Apple configuration profiles can be weaponized for advanced red teaming and security testing on iOS and macOS devices.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**MobileConfig** files are Apple’s configuration profile format used to manage device settings. These files can automate VPN setup, enforce restrictions, modify Wi-Fi connections, install root certificates, and more.  
When used creatively in a red team operation, they enable phishing, traffic manipulation, device policy tampering, and persistence.

## 🧪 Examples

| File                              | Purpose                               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `vpn_mobileconfig.mobileconfig`   | Auto-connect to controlled VPN        |
| `proxy_mobileconfig.mobileconfig` | Intercept traffic via custom proxy    |
| `cert_install.mobileconfig`       | Install fake root certificate         |
| `disable_camera.mobileconfig`     | Disable camera on the device   
| `fake_app.mobileconfig`     | phishing page With WebClip           |

All examples are located in the `/examples/` folder.



## 🕸️ Web-Based Delivery Samples

Delivering `.mobileconfig` files via phishing-style webpages is highly effective.  
You can host a fake page and convince the user to install the profile.
| File                              | Purpose                               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `wifi_signup.html`   | Fake Wi-Fi login portal        |
| `vpn_org_setup.html` | Corporate VPN configuration page    |
| `cert_install.html`       | Certificate update for compliance         |
| `app_install.html`     | Fake Application For WebClip  

All examples are located in the `/web_samples/` folder.

## Note: `Content-Type: application/x-apple-aspen-config`

- This header tells iOS/macOS that the file is an Apple configuration profile (`.mobileconfig`).
- It ensures the device recognizes the file and prompts the user to install it.
- Without it, the profile might just download without triggering installation.
- Use it on your server when serving `.mobileconfig` files for smooth installation.


### 🌐 Hosting Example
  ----------
`python3 -m http.server 8080` 

Open the hosted page on Safari (iOS/macOS) and the system will prompt the user to install the profile.

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** The user must manually confirm installation via system settings.
